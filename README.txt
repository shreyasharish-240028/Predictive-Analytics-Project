# Predictive Analytics Project

## Business Problem
Retailers struggle to forecast demand for plant-based meat products. Overstock causes spoilage and losses, while understock results in missed revenue opportunities.

This project builds a machine learning model to predict product demand using product and manufacturer attributes.

## Objective
Develop a predictive model to estimate demand and identify factors influencing product sales.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Product attributes
- Manufacturer information
- Cleaned and processed sales data

Raw data was cleaned, merged, and feature engineered before modeling.

## Methods Used
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Regression / Machine Learning Modeling
- Model Evaluation

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
The model identified important drivers of demand including brand, product characteristics, and manufacturer features. The results can support inventory planning and reduce stockouts and waste.
